**Online Analysis Tool**  


This ShinyApp is a prototype to be used in a undergrad class helping students do their class exercises.  
The idea is that the students can load their datasets and run online tests.  
This will be a long term project, right now it's only a glimpse.  

It was implemented two things: a factorial analysis with fixed parameters and a hierarchical cluster also with fixed parameters.
